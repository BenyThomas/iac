# Platform

This directory contains configuration and operational guidance for the shared Kubernetes platform services that run on the RKE2 clusters.

## Structure
- `networking/` — CNI, NetworkPolicies, MetalLB, and ingress controller configuration.
- `vsphere/` — vSphere-specific notes for CPI/CSI and VM templates.

See the subdirectories for component-specific manifests and runbooks.
